Vendor section
==============

The vendor section contains the documents in which the user is the vendor and provides services.

The expected workflow for vendors is composed of the following steps:

#. The MyLabs team makes and sends a :guilabel:`Request for quotation` indicating what equipments and services they needs with a previous quotation of them.
#. **The vendor** must review and indicate what equipments and services are available and confirm the prices by selecting the corresponding lines.
#. The MyLabs team checks the chosen equipments and services to generate the order and send it to the vendor once the client has accepted the quotation.
#. **The vendor** must review and confirm that the order is achievable. Then, the vendor must perform it, confirm when the order is done and send the report to the MyLabs team.
#. The MyLabs team notifies the client, resend the reports and generate an invoice template.
#. **The vendor** must review the invoice and confirm it or generate its own invoice and send it to the MyLabs team.
#. The MyLabs team will pay the invoice following the payment terms.
