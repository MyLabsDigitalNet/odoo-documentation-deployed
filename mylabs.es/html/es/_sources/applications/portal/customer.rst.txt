Customer section
================

The customer section contains the documents in which the user is the customer and orders services.

The expected workflow for clients is composed of the following steps:

#. **The client** makes a :guilabel:`Request for quotation` indicating what tests, services and/or equipments they needs.
#. The MyLabs team uses an algorithm to select the most suitable equipment to carry out the services. Send the proposal to carry out the services to the selected universities or laboratories. Once the universities and laboratories confirm the availability to carry out the services, the MyLabs team sends the client a quote.
#. **The client** must review and accept the quotation to generate the order.
#. The MyLabs team notifies the universities and laboratories of the acceptance of the services to begin the experiments. Once the tests have been carried out, the reports are sent to the client. The service invoice is also generated and sent.
#. **The client** must review the invoice and make the payment according to the chosen method.

Once the servile line is in edit mode, you can specfify the test, the service and the equipment you need.
It is not mandatory to fill in all the fields, but the more specific the request, the easier it will be for the salespersons to generate the quotation.
Each of the :guilabel:`Test` ,:guilabel:`Equipment Type` and :guilabel:`Equipment Service` fields are dinamically filtered depending on the value of the other fields.
So, if you select a Test, the :guilabel:`Equipment Type` and :guilabel:`Equipment Service` fields will be filtered to show only the Equipment Type and Equipment Service that are related to the selected Test.
