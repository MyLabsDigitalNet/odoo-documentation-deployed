==================
Internal transfers
==================

In Odoo, internal money transfers can be made in a few clicks. You need at least either two bank
accounts, two cash journals, or one bank account and one cash journal.

Configuration
=============

An internal transfer account is automatically created on your database based on your company's
localization and depending on your country’s legislation. If needed, the default :guilabel:`Internal
transfer account` can be modified by going to :menuselection:`Accounting app --> Configuration -->
Settings` and then under the :guilabel:`Default Accounts` section.

.. note::
   At least two bank accounts are needed to make internal transfers. Refer to
   :doc:`Bank and cash accounts section <../bank>` to see how to add an additional bank
   account to your database.

Register an internal transfer from one bank to another
======================================================

Let's say you have two bank accounts registered on your database and you want to transfer 1,000 USD
from Bank A to Bank B.

Log an internal transfer
------------------------

From the Accounting Dashboard, click on the drop-down selection button (:guilabel:`⋮`) on one of
your banks. In the :guilabel:`New` column click on :guilabel:`Internal Transfer` and enter the
information related to the transfer.

.. note::
   Fill in the :guilabel:`Memo` field for automatic reconciliation.

:guilabel:`Save` and :guilabel:`Confirm` to register your internal transfer. The money is now booked
in the transfer account and another payment is **automatically** created in the destination journal
(Bank B).
