Lead mining
===========

Lead mining is a feature that allows CRM users to generate new leads directly into their Odoo
database. To ensure lead qualification, lead mining output is determined by a variety of filtering
criteria, such as the country, the company size, and the industry.

Configuration
=============

To get started, go to :menuselection:`CRM --> Configuration --> Settings` and activate
:guilabel:`Lead Mining`.

Leads` is available to use in the :guilabel:`CRM` pipeline. Lead mining requests are also available
through :menuselection:`CRM --> Configuration --> Lead Mining Requests`, or through
