Down payments
=============

A down payment is a partial payment made by the buyer when a sales contract is concluded. This
implies both parties' (seller and buyer) full commitment to honor the contract.

With a down payment, the buyer pays a portion of the total amount owed while agreeing to pay the
remaining amount at a later date. In turn, the seller provides goods or services to the buyer after
accepting the down payment, trusting that the remaining amount will be paid later on.

Create invoices
===============

When a sales order is confirmed, the option to create an invoice becomes available, via the
:guilabel:`Create Invoice` button, located in the upper-left corner of the sales order form. When
clicked, a :guilabel:`Create invoices` pop-up appears.

.. note::
   Invoices are automatically created as drafts, so they can be reviewed before validation.

On the :guilabel:`Create invoices` pop-up, there are 3 options to choose from in the
:guilabel:`Create Invoice` field:

- :guilabel:`Regular invoice`
- :guilabel:`Down payment (percentage)`
- :guilabel:`Down payment (fixed amount)`

.. note::
   If :guilabel:`Regular Invoice` is selected, the other fields disappear, as they only pertain to
   down payment configurations.

Initial down payment request
============================

On the :guilabel:`Create invoices` pop-up form, the down payment options are:

- :guilabel:`Down payment (percentage)`
- :guilabel:`Down payment (fixed amount)`

Once the desired down payment option is selected in the :guilabel:`Create Invoice` field on the
pop-up form, designate the desired amount, either as a percentage or a fixed amount, in the
:guilabel:`Down Payment Amount` field.

Then, select the appropriate income account for the invoice in the :guilabel:`Income Account` field.
Next, select a tax amount, if necessary, in the :guilabel:`Customer Taxes` drop-down field.

Once all fields are filled in with the desired information, click the :guilabel:`Create Draft
Invoice` button. Upon clicking this button, Odoo reveals the :guilabel:`Customer Invoice Draft`.

In the :guilabel:`Invoice Lines` tab of the :guilabel:`Customer Invoice Draft`, the down payment
that was just configured in the :guilabel:`Create invoices` pop-up form appears as a
:guilabel:`Product`.

.. image:: down_payment/borrador_anticipo.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Pago inicial como producto en la pestaña de líneas de factura de un borrador de factura

.. note::
   When the :guilabel:`Down payment` product in the :guilabel:`Invoice Lines` tab is clicked, Odoo
   reveals the product form for the down payment.

   By default, the :guilabel:`Product Type` of down payment products generated for invoices are set
   as :guilabel:`Service`, with the :guilabel:`Invoicing Policy` set to :guilabel:`Prepaid/Fixed
   Price`.

   .. image:: down_payment/ficha_anticipo.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Ficha de producto de anticipo

   This product can be edited/modified at any time.

.. warning::
   If :guilabel:`Based on Delivered Quantity (Manual)` is chosen as the :guilabel:`Invoicing
   Policy`, an invoice will **not** be able to be created.

Example: request 50% down payment
=================================

.. note::
   The following example involves a 50% amount down payment on a product (:guilabel:`Cabinet with
   Doors`) with :guilabel:`Ordered quantities` as the :guilabel:`Invoicing Policy`.

   .. image:: down_payment/politica_cantidades.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Formulario de producto que muestra varios detalles y campos

.. seealso::
   :doc:`invoicing_policy`

First, navigate to :menuselection:`Sales app --> New`, and add a :guilabel:`Customer` to the
quotation.

Then, click :guilabel:`Add a product` in the :guilabel:`Order Lines` tab, and select the
:guilabel:`Cabinet with Doors` product.

When the order is confirmed (via the :guilabel:`Confirm` button), the quotation turns into a sales
order. Once this occurs, create and view the invoice by clicking :guilabel:`Create Invoice`.

Next, on the :guilabel:`Create invoices` pop-up window that appears, select :guilabel:`Down payment
(percentage)`, and type `50` in the :guilabel:`Down Payment Amount` field.

.. note::
   The :guilabel:`Income Account` and :guilabel:`Customer Taxes` fields are *not* required fields,
   and they will *not* appear if they've already been preconfigured in previous down payment
   requests.

   For more information, check out the documentation on :ref:`customer taxes modification on down
   payments <sales/invoicing/customer-tax-modification-down-payments>` and :ref:`income account
   modification on down payments <sales/invoicing/income-account-modification>`.

Lastly, click :guilabel:`Create Draft Invoice` to create and view the invoice draft.

Clicking :guilabel:`Create Draft Invoice` reveals the draft invoice, which includes the down
payment as a :guilabel:`Product` in the :guilabel:`Invoice Lines` tab.

From there, the invoice can be confirmed and posted by clicking :guilabel:`Confirm`. Confirming the
invoice changes the status from :guilabel:`Draft` to :guilabel:`Posted`. It also reveals a new
series of buttons at the top of the page.

   :align: center

From those buttons, the payment can be registered by clicking :guilabel:`Register Payment`.

.. image:: down_payment/registrar_pago.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Demostración del botón Registrar Pago en una factura de cliente confirmada.

Doing so reveals a :guilabel:`Register Payment` pop-up form, which is auto-populated with the
necessary information. Confirm the information provided is correct and make any necessary
adjustments. When ready, click the :guilabel:`Create Payment` button.

.. image:: down_payment/crear_pago.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Demostración de la ventana emergente Registrar Pago con el botón Crear Pago

After clicking :guilabel:`Create Payment`, Odoo reveals the customer invoice, now with a green
:guilabel:`In Payment` banner in the upper-right corner.

.. image:: down_payment/presupuesto_pagado.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Banner verde con el texto "pagado"

Now, when the customer wants to pay the remaining amount of the order, another invoice must be
created. To do that, return to the sales order, via the breadcrumb links.

Back on the sales order, a new :guilabel:`Down Payments` section is present in the :guilabel:`Order
Lines` tab, along with the down payment that was just invoiced and posted.

.. image:: down_payment/anticipo_resto.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Seccion anticipo en la linea del pedido

Next, click the :guilabel:`Create Invoice` button.

On the :guilabel:`Create invoices` pop-up window that appears, there is a new field:
:guilabel:`Deducir anticipo`

.. image:: down_payment/deducir_anticipo.png
   :align: center
   :alt: La opción de deducir el pago inicial en la ventana emergente de crear facturas en Odoo Sales.

If the remaining amount is ready to be paid, select the :guilabel:`Regular Invoice` option. Odoo
will create an invoice for the exact amount needed to complete the total payment, as indicated in
the :guilabel:`Amount to invoice` field.

Once ready, click :guilabel:`Create Draft Invoice`.

Doing so reveals another :guilabel:`Customer Invoice Draft` page, listing *all* the invoices for
that specific sales order in the :guilabel:`Invoice Lines` tab. Each invoice line item displays all
the necessary information related to each invoice.

To complete the flow, click :guilabel:`Confirm`, which changes the status of the invoice from
:guilabel:`Draft` to :guilabel:`Posted`. Then, click :guilabel:`Register Payment`.

Once again, the :guilabel:`Register Payment` appears, with all fields auto-populated with the
necessary information, including the remaining amount left to be paid on the order.

.. image:: down_payment/crear_pago.png
   :align: center
   :alt: El segundo formulario emergente de registrar pago en Odoo

After confirming that information, click :guilabel:`Create Payment`. Doing so reveals the final
:guilabel:`Customer Invoice` with a green :guilabel:`In Payment` banner in the upper-right corner.
Also, both down payments are present in the :guilabel:`Invoice Lines` tab.

.. image:: down_payment/segundo_anticipo_pago.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Banner de pagado en el segundo anticipo

At this point, the flow is now complete.

.. note::
   This flow is also possible with the :guilabel:`Fixed amount` down payment option.

.. important::
   If a down payment is used with a product that has a :guilabel:`Delivered quantities` invoicing
   policy, the down payments will **not** be able to be deducted when it comes time to invoice the
   customer.

   This is because, due to the invoicing policy, the product(s) would have to be delivered *before*
   creating the final invoice.

   If nothing has been delivered, a :guilabel:`Credit Note` is created, which cancels the draft
   invoice that was created after the down payment.

   To utilize the :guilabel:`Credit Note` option, the *Inventory* application must be installed, in
   order to confirm the delivery. Otherwise, the delivered quantity can be entered manually directly
   on the sales order.
