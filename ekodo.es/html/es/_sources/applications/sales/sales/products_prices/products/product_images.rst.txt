Product images with Google Images
=================================

Having appropriate product images in Odoo is useful for a number of reasons. However, if a lot of
products need images, assigning them can become incredibly time-consuming.

Fortunately, by configuring the *Google Custom Search* API within an Odoo database, finding product
images for products (based on their barcode) is extremely efficient.

Configuration
=============

In order to utilize *Google Custom Search* within an Odoo database, both the database and the Google
API must be properly configured.

.. note::
   Free Google accounts allow users to select up to 100 free images per day. If a higher amount is
   needed, a billing upgrade is required.

Google API dashboard
--------------------

#. Go to the `Google Cloud Platform API & Services <https://console.developers.google.com/>`_ page
   to generate Google Custom Search API credentials. Then, log in with a Google account. Next, agree
   to their :guilabel:`Terms of Service` by checking the box, and clicking :guilabel:`Agree and
   Continue`.
#. From here, select (or create) an API project to store the credentials. Start by giving it a
   memorable :guilabel:`Project Name`, select a :guilabel:`Location` (if any), then click
   :guilabel:`Create`.
#. With the :guilabel:`Credentials` option selected in the left sidebar, click :guilabel:`Create
   Credentials`, and select :guilabel:`API key` from the drop-down menu.

#. Doing so reveals an :guilabel:`API key created` pop-up window, containing a custom :guilabel:`API
   key`. Copy and save :guilabel:`Your API key` in the pop-up window -- it will be used later. Once
   the key is copied (and saved for later use), click :guilabel:`Close` to remove the pop-up window.

Product images in Odoo with Google Custom Search API
====================================================

Adding images to products in Odoo can be done on any product or product variant. This process can be
completed in any Odoo application that provides access to product pages (e.g. *Sales* app,
*Inventory* app, etc.).

Below is a step-by-step guide detailing how to utilize the *Google Custom Search API* to assign
images to products in Odoo using the Odoo *Sales* application:

#. Navigate to the :guilabel:`Products` page in the *Sales* app (:menuselection:`Sales app -->
   Products --> Products`). Or, navigate to the :guilabel:`Product Variants` page in the *Sales* app
   (:menuselection:`Sales app --> Products --> Product Variants`).
#. Select the desired product that needs an image.

   .. note::
      Only products (or product variants) that have a barcode, but **not** an image, are processed.

      If a product with one or more variants is selected, each variant that matches the
      aforementioned criteria is processed.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Action ⚙️ (gear)` icon on the product page, and select :guilabel:`Get
   Pictures from Google Images` from the menu that pops up.

   .. image:: product_images/accion_obtener_imagenes.png

#. On the pop-up window that appears, click :guilabel:`Get Pictures`.

   .. image:: product_images/obtener_imagenes.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Pop up previo a la obtencion de imagenes de google

#. Once clicked, the image(s) will appear incrementally.

   .. note::
      Only the first 10 images are fetched immediately. If you selected more than 10, the rest are
      fetched as a background job.

      The background job processes about 100 images in a minute. If the quota authorized by Google
      (either with a free or a paid plan) is reached, the background job puts itself on hold for 24
      hours. Then, it will continue where it stopped the day before.
