========================
Mail Optional Autofollow
========================

The **Mail Optional Autofollow** module adds the ability to choose whether or not to automatically 
add new recipients as followers when using the `mail.compose.message` form in Odoo. This gives users 
greater control over who receives future notifications related to specific documents.

.. note::
   If this functionality is not enabled in your system, please contact support, and we will activate 
   it for you.

How to Use the Module
=====================

Once the module is enabled, it functions as follows:

- When composing a message related to a document (e.g., an invoice or a sales order), you will see a 
checkbox labeled **autofollow recipients**.
- By default, this checkbox is selected if the message's context includes the `mail_post_autofollow` 
key.

Example Usage
=============

Let's consider a scenario where you are sending a message from an invoice to a customer:

1. **Compose the Message**:
   Open the invoice and click to send a message. In the message composition window, add the customer's 
   email address as a recipient.

2. **Decide on Autofollow**:
   - If you leave the **autofollow recipients** checkbox selected, the customer will automatically be 
   added as a follower of the invoice. This means they will receive any future updates or notifications 
   related to this invoice.
   - If you uncheck the **autofollow recipients** option, the customer will receive the current message, 
   but they will not be added as a follower. Therefore, they wonâ€™t receive further notifications unless 
   they are manually added later.

This feature is particularly useful for controlling notification flow, ensuring that only relevant contacts 
receive ongoing updates, while still allowing one-time communications when needed.

Additional Considerations
=========================

- **Use Case**: The ability to opt-in or out of automatic following is especially useful when you need 
to keep some contacts informed without overloading them with notifications.
