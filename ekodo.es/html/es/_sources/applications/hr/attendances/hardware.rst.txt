Kiosk management
================

A kiosk is a self-service station that allows employees to check in and check out for work shifts.

There are two ways to set up a kiosk:

- **Laptop and desktop PC**

  Running a kiosk in a web browser is the cheapest and most flexible option. You can print employee
  badges with any thermal or inkjet printer compatible with your web browser.

- **Tablet and mobile phone (Android or iOS)**

  Tablets and mobile phones take up much less space, and their touchscreens are easy to use.
  Consider putting them in a secure stand at the front desk or mounting them securely on a wall.


RFID key fob readers
====================

Employees can scan personal RFID key fobs with an RFID reader to manage check-ins and check-outs
quickly and easily.

   An IoT box is **not** required.

Barcode scanners
================

Employees can scan the barcode on their employee badges to manage check-ins and check-outs quickly
and easily. The kiosk mode works with most USB barcode scanners connected directly to a computer.
Bluetooth barcode scanners are also supported natively.

   An IoT box is **not** required.
