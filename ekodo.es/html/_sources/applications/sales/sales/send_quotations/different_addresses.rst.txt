Deliveries and invoices to different addresses
==============================================

People and businesses often use separate addresses for billing (invoicing) and shipping (delivery)
purposes. With the Odoo *Sales* app, contacts can have different specified addresses for delivery
and invoicing.

Contact form configuration
==========================

To add multiple addresses to a contact, go to :menuselection:`Sales app --> Orders --> Customers`,
and clear any default filters from the search bar. Then, click on the desired customer to open their
contact form.

.. tip::
   Contact forms can be accessed in the *Contacts* application, as well.

From the contact form, click :guilabel:`Edit`, and then select :guilabel:`Add`, which is located
under the :guilabel:`Contacts & Addresses` tab. Doing so reveals a :guilabel:`Create Contact` pop-up
form, in which additional addresses can be configured.

On the :guilabel:`Create Contact` pop-up form, start by clicking the default :guilabel:`Other
Address` field to reveal a drop-down menu of address-related options.

Select any of the following options:

- :guilabel:`Contact`: adds another contact to the existing contact form.
- :guilabel:`Invoice Address`: adds a specific invoice address to the existing contact form.
- :guilabel:`Delivery Address`: adds a specific delivery address to the existing contact form.
- :guilabel:`Other Address`: adds an alternate address to the existing contact form.
- :guilabel:`Private Address`: adds a private address to the existing contact form.

Once an option is selected, proceed to enter the corresponding contact information that should be
used for the specified address type.

Then, click :guilabel:`Save & Close` to save the address and close the :guilabel:`Create Contact`
window. Or, click :guilabel:`Save & New` to save the address and immediately input another one.

Address added to quotations
===========================

When a customer is added to a quotation, the :guilabel:`Invoice Address` and :guilabel:`Delivery
Address` fields autopopulate with the corresponding addresses specified on the customer's contact
form.

The :guilabel:`Invoice Address` and :guilabel:`Delivery Address` can also be edited directly from
the quotation by clicking the :guilabel:`Edit` button, and then clicking the :guilabel:`➡️ (right
arrow)` internal link buttons next to each address line.

These addresses can be updated at any time to ensure accurate invoicing and delivery.

.. tip::
   If any changes are made on a form in Odoo, include *Contacts* forms, remember to click
   :guilabel:`Save` to save the changes to the database.
