Trial Balance
=============

A trial balance is a report where the balances of all the accounts in a company's general ledger are 
displayed at a given time.

The balance covers all important accounting elements, such as assets, liabilities, equity, income, 
expenses, profits, and losses. Its main purpose is to show the current state of the debits and credits 
in the general ledger at a specific moment.

Creating a trial balance is the first step in closing the accounting books at the end of the financial 
year (or another accounting period) and ensures that the accounts are "balanced." If the totals in the 
debit and credit columns of the general ledger accounts do not match, the trial balance indicates the 
need to correct something.

General Ledger
--------------

The **General Ledger Report** shows all transactions from all accounts for a chosen date range. The
initial summary report shows each account's totals; from here, you can view a detailed transaction
report or any exceptions. This report helps check every transaction that occurred during a specific
period.

Journal
=======

The journal, also known as the accounting journal or general journal, is a financial record where all 
business and financial transactions of a company are recorded in the order they occur.

Each transaction is recorded in terms of debit and credit, and a brief description of the transaction 
is provided along with the corresponding amounts.

VAT book
========

The VAT books are the mandatory records in which taxpayers, entrepreneurs, and freelancers record the 
operations they carry out during their professional activity, complying with a series of obligations 
dictated by law.

The data recorded in the books must specify the VAT charged by the entrepreneur or freelancer to customers 
and the VAT paid, with all the necessary details to prepare the VAT return.

The VAT books can be digitized, in which case, the law requires that they be kept in magnetic or optical 
format until the prescription period has passed, along with the files, databases, and programs necessary 
to access them.

Taxpayers with a monthly VAT self-assessment period must keep the VAT books through the AEAT's electronic 
headquarters.

Open items
==========

Run the open items report for payables and receivables to show information about individual invoices, 
specific amounts owed, the time they have been unpaid, and the sales invoices pending collection during 
the selected month and several previous months.
