To make it more convenient for your customers to pay the invoices you issue, you can activate the
**Invoice Online Payment** feature, which adds a *Pay Now* button on their **Customer Portal**. This
allows your customers to see their invoices online and pay directly with their favorite payment
method, making the payment process much easier.

Configuration
=============

Make sure your :doc:`payment providers are correctly configured <../../payment_providers>`.

.. note::
   By default, ":doc:`Wire Transfer </applications/finance/payment_providers/wire_transfer>`" is the
   only payment provider activated, but you still have to fill out the payment details.

To activate the Invoice Online Payment, go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration -->
Settings --> Customer Payments`, enable **Invoice Online Payment**, and click on *Save*.

Customer Portal
===============

After issuing the invoice, click on *Send & Print* and send the invoice by email to the customer.
They will receive an email with a link that redirects them to the invoice on their **Customer
Portal**.
