Vendor bills
============

In Odoo, we can register vendor bills **manually** or **automatically**, while the
**Aged Payable report** provides an overview of all outstanding bills to help us pay the correct
amounts on time.

Automatically
-------------

Vendor bills can be automatically created by **sending an email** to an :ref:`email alias
<invoice-digitization/email-alias>` associated with the purchase journal, or by **uploading a PDF**
in :menuselection:`Accounting --> Vendors --> Bills` and then clicking :guilabel:`Upload`.

Bill completion
===============

Whether the bill is created manually or automatically, make sure the following fields are
appropriately completed:

- :guilabel:`Vendor`: Odoo automatically fills some information based on the vendor's registered
  information, previous purchase orders, or bills.
- :guilabel:`Bill Reference`: Add the sales order reference provided by the vendor and is used to do
  the :ref:`matching <payments/matching>` When you receive the products.
- :guilabel:`Auto-Complete`: Select a past bill/purchase order to automatically complete the
  document. The :guilabel:`Vendor` Field should be completed prior to completing this field.
- :guilabel:`Bill Date`: Is the issuance date of the document.
- :guilabel:`Accounting Date`: Is the date on which the document is registered in your accounting.
- :guilabel:`Payment Reference`: When registering the payment, it is automatically indicated in the
  :guilabel:`Memo` field.
- :guilabel:`Recipient Bank`: To indicate to which account number the payment has to be made.
- :guilabel:`Due Date` or :guilabel:`Terms` to pay the bill.
- :guilabel:`Journal`: Select in which journal the bill should be recorded and the :doc:`Currency
  <get_started/multi_currency>`.
- :guilabel:`Product`: We indicate where we want to categorize the invoice lines; this must be
  pre-configured beforehand.
- :guilabel:`Label`: A brief summary of the invoice line.
- :guilabel:`Account`: When specifying the product, Odoo automatically fills this information.
- :guilabel:`Asset Category`: Only for asset invoices.
- :guilabel:`Price`: The taxable base of the product line.
- :guilabel:`Tax`: Automatically populated, as it will be pre-configured when specifying the product.
- :guilabel:`Quantity`: The unit of the product line (in case it needs to be itemized).
- :guilabel:`Price`: The unit price of the product.

Bill confirmation
=================

Click :guilabel:`Confirm` when the document is completed. The status of your document changes to
:guilabel:`Posted` and a journal entry is generated based on the configuration on the invoice.

.. note::
   Once confirmed, it is no longer possible to update it. Click :guilabel:`Reset to draft` if
   changes are required.

Bill Payment
============

We have two ways to reconcile the supplier's payment:

1. By clicking on Register Payment, which will open a new window. Please note that in order to
register the payment this way, it must be pre-configured accordingly.

We provide the bank journal, the payment method, the bank account, the amount to be paid
(full or partial), the payment date, and the memo, which includes the invoice with its internal 
reference.

When we click Create Payment, the invoice will be confirmed, and a banner with the message 
"In payment process" will appear until the invoice is reconciled.

2. Another way is to reconcile the invoices directly from the bank

This is the recommended method as it will directly reconcile the supplier's invoice with the bank.


Aged payable report
===================

To get an overview of your open vendor bills and their related due dates, you can use the
**Aged Payable report**. Go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Reporting --> Partner Reports: Aged
payable`.

Click on a vendor's name to open up the details of all outstanding bills, the amounts due, the due
dates, etc.

.. Note::
   - By clicking the :guilabel:`Save` button, you can export the information available on the screen
     as a PDF or XLSX file and save it in the folder of your choice.
   - You might receive several bills for the same purchase order if your vendor is in back-order and
     is sending you invoices as they ship the products, or if your vendor is sending you a partial
     bill or asking for a deposit.
