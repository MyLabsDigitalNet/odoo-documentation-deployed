Bank and cash accounts
======================

You can manage as many bank or cash accounts as needed on your database. Configuring them well
allows you to have all your banking data up-to-date and ready for :doc:`reconciliation
<bank/reconciliation>` with your journal entries.

In Odoo Accounting, each bank account has a dedicated journal set to post all entries in a dedicated
account. Both the journal and the account are automatically created and configured whenever you add
a bank account.

.. note::
   Cash journals and accounts must be configured manually.

Bank journals are displayed by default on the :guilabel:`Accounting Dashboard` in the form of cards
which include action buttons.

Bank feeds

:guilabel:`Bank Feeds` defines how the bank statements are registered. Three options are available:

- :guilabel:`Undefined yet`, which should be selected when you don’t know yet if you will

Configuration of Bank and Cash Journals
---------------------------------------

You can also set specific pending accounts for any Bank or Cash type journal.
From the Accounting Dashboard, click on the ⋮ menu of the journal you want to configure, and click 
on Configuration. Then, open the Incoming/Outgoing Payments tab. To display the pending accounts 
column, click on the toggle button and check the box for Pending Receivable/Payable Accounts, then 
update the account.

.. important::
   If you do not specify a pending payment account or a pending receivable account for a specific journal, 
   Odoo will use the default pending accounts.

If your main bank account is added as a pending receivable or payable account, when a payment is recorded, 
the status of the invoice or receipt is set directly to Paid.

Bank Synchronization
--------------------

Odoo can sync directly with your bank so that all bank statements are automatically imported into your 
database.

First Synchronization
---------------------

You can start the synchronization by going to the Accounting application and then to Accounting Dashboard ‣ Configuration ‣ Journals: Bank.
Then, select the provider.
