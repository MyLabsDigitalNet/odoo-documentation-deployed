Bank and cash accounts
======================

You can manage as many bank or cash accounts as needed on your database. Configuring them well
allows you to have all your banking data up-to-date and ready for :doc:`reconciliation
<bank/reconciliation>` with your journal entries.

In Odoo Accounting, each bank account has a dedicated journal set to post all entries in a dedicated
account. Both the journal and the account are automatically created and configured whenever you add
a bank account.

.. note::
   Cash journals and accounts must be configured manually.

Bank journals are displayed by default on the :guilabel:`Accounting Dashboard` in the form of cards
which include action buttons.

.. _bank_accounts/suspense:

Suspense account
----------------

Bank statement transactions are posted on the Suspense Account until the final
reconciliation allows finding the right account.

.. Profit and loss accounts
------------------------

.. The :guilabel:`Profit Account` is used to register a profit when the ending balance of a cash
register differs from what the system computes, while the :guilabel:`Loss Account` is used to
register a loss when the ending balance of a cash register differs from what the system computes.

Currency
--------

You can edit the currency used to enter the statements.


Account number
--------------

If you need to **edit your bank account details**, click on the external link arrow next to your
:guilabel:`Account Number`. On the new page, click on the external link arrow next to your
:guilabel:`Bank` and update your bank information accordingly. These details are used when
registering payments.

Bank feeds
----------

:guilabel:`Bank Feeds` defines how the bank statements are registered. Three options are available:

- :guilabel:`Undefined yet`, which should be selected when you don’t know yet if you will
  synchronize your bank account with your database or not.
- :guilabel:`Import (N43, TXT/CSV)`, which should be selected if you want to import
  your bank statement using a different format.

Configuration of Bank and Cash Journals
---------------------------------------

You can also set specific pending accounts for any Bank or Cash type journal.
From the Accounting Dashboard, click on the ⋮ menu of the journal you want to configure, and click 
on Configuration. Then, open the Incoming/Outgoing Payments tab. To display the pending accounts 
column, click on the toggle button and check the box for Pending Receivable/Payable Accounts, then 
update the account.

.. important::
   If you do not specify a pending payment account or a pending receivable account for a specific journal, 
   Odoo will use the default pending accounts.

If your main bank account is added as a pending receivable or payable account, when a payment is recorded, 
the status of the invoice or receipt is set directly to Paid.

Bank Synchronization
--------------------

Odoo can sync directly with your bank so that all bank statements are automatically imported into your 
database.

First Synchronization
---------------------

You can start the synchronization by going to the Accounting application and then to Accounting Dashboard ‣ Configuration ‣ Journals: Bank.
Then, select the provider.

You can now search for your banking institution. Select it and follow the steps to synchronize it.

.. _bank/outstanding-accounts:

.. Outstanding accounts
====================

.. By default, payments are registered through transitory accounts named **outstanding accounts**,
before being recorded in your bank account.

.. - An **outstanding payments account** is where outgoing payments are posted until they are linked
  with a withdrawal from your bank statement.
- An **outstanding receipts account** is where incoming payments are posted until they are linked
  with a deposit from your bank statement.

.. These accounts should be of :ref:`type <chart-of-account/type>` :guilabel:`Current Assets`.

.. .. note::
   The movement from an outstanding account to a bank account is done automatically when you
   reconcile the bank account with a bank statement.

.. Default accounts configuration
------------------------------

.. The outstanding accounts are defined by default. If necessary, you can update them by going to
:menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Default Accounts` and update your
:guilabel:`Outstanding Receipts Account` and :guilabel:`Outstanding Payments Account`.

.. Bank and cash journals configuration
------------------------------------

.. You can also set specific outstanding accounts for any journal with the :ref:`type
<chart-of-account/type>` :guilabel:`Bank` or :guilabel:`Cash`.

.. From your :guilabel:`Accounting Dashboard`, click on the menu selection ⋮ of the journal you want to
configure, and click on :guilabel:`Configuration`, then open the :guilabel:`Incoming/Outgoing
Payments` tab. To display the outstanding accounts column, click on the toggle button and check the
:guilabel:`Outstanding Receipts/Payments accounts`, then update the account.

.. .. note::
   - If you do not specify an outstanding payments account or an outstanding receipts account for a
     specific journal, Odoo uses the default outstanding accounts.
   - If your main bank account is added as an outstanding receipts account or outstanding payments
     account, when a payment is registered, the invoice or bill's status is directly set to
     :guilabel:`Paid`.
