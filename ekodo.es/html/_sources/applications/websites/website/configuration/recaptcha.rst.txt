reCAPTCHA v3 on forms
=====================

Google's reCAPTCHA protects website forms against spam and abuse. It attempts to distinguish between
human and bot submissions.

.. warning::
   reCAPTCHA v3 may not be compliant with local data protection regulations.

.. note::
   reCAPTCHA v3 works in the background and does not interrupt visitors. However, if the check
   fails, visitors cannot submit the form.

Configuration
=============

On Google
---------

Open `the reCAPTCHA website registration page <https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create>`_. Log
in or create a Google account if necessary.

On the website registration page:

- Give the website a :guilabel:`Label`.
- Leave the :guilabel:`reCAPTCHA type` on :guilabel:`Score based (v3)`.
- Enter one or more :guilabel:`Domains` (e.g., *example.com* or *subdomain.example.com*).
- Under :guilabel:`Google Cloud Platform`, a project is automatically selected if one was already
  created with the logged-in Google account. If not, one is automatically created. Click
  :guilabel:`Google Cloud Platform` to select a project yourself or rename the automatically created
  project.
- Agree to the terms of service.
- Click :guilabel:`Submit`.

A new page with the generated keys is then displayed. Leave it open for convenience, as copying the
keys to Odoo is required next.

On Odoo
-------

- From the database dashboard, click :guilabel:`Settings`. Under :guilabel:`Integrations`, enable
  :guilabel:`reCAPTCHA` if needed.

  .. warning::
     Do not disable the :guilabel:`reCAPTCHA` feature or uninstall the :guilabel:`Google reCAPTCHA
     integration` module, as many other modules would also be removed.

- Open the Google reCAPTCHA page, copy the :guilabel:`Site key`, and paste it into the
  :guilabel:`Site Key` field in Odoo.
- Open the Google reCAPTCHA page, copy the :guilabel:`Secret key`, and paste it into the
  :guilabel:`Secret Key` field in Odoo.
- Change the default :guilabel:`Minimum score` (`0.5`) if necessary, using a value between `1.0`
  and `0.0`. The higher the threshold is, the more difficult it is to pass the reCAPTCHA, and vice
  versa.
- Click :guilabel:`Save`.

All pages using the :guilabel:`Form`, :guilabel:`Newsletter Block`, :guilabel:`Newsletter Popup`
snippets, and the eCommerce :guilabel:`Extra Step During Checkout` form are now protected by
reCAPTCHA.
