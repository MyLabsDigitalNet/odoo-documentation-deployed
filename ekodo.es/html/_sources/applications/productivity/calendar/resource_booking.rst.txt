To create a resource combination:

#. Navigate to the :menuselection:`Resource Booking` module.
#. Click on :guilabel:`Combinations` and then :guilabel:`Create`.

.. image:: resource_booking/horario.png

#. Assign a name to the combination and define any specific constraints, such as availability or priority.
#. Click :guilabel:`Save` to create the resource combination.

.. _create_booking_types:

Create Booking Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Booking types define the type of appointments or reservations that can be made with the resources. For example, you might have a **Dental Consultation** type that uses a combination of a doctor and an office.

To create a booking type:

#. Navigate to the :menuselection:`Resource Booking` module.
#. Click on :guilabel:`Booking Types` and then :guilabel:`Create`.
#. Fill in the details, such as :guilabel:`Name` (e.g., Dental Consultation), :guilabel:`Default Duration` (e.g., 20 minutes), and :guilabel:`Modification Deadline` (e.g., 24 hours before the booking).

   .. image:: resource_booking/crear_tipo.png
      :alt: Booking Type Form

#. Define the order of resource combinations to use for this booking type. For example, you can prioritize certain doctors or offices.
#. Add any specific instructions for the booking, such as "Please attend with clean teeth."
#. Click :guilabel:`Save` to finalize the booking type.
